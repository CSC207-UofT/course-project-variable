# Specification:

- Running the application initially asks the user for an existing
log-in, or to create a new account using a username and password
of their choosing
- Once logged in, a new user can now either:
  - choose to import a compatible calendar file,
  - manually schedule their events to a new calendar
- If the user chooses to manually schedule their events, 
they will be asked for:
  - the courses/recurring events they are currently participating
in
  - the times and days when these events occur
- Once the user has completed the above steps, they can now:
  - View the scheduled events in their calendar
  - Add or remove events (either recurring
  or one-off) from their schedule
  - View which study group they are in
  - Join a new study group (via a group ID)
  - Create a new study group
- After a user has joined a study group with more than one 
member, they will be able to access the time in which all members 
within the group are free to conduct group work/study
