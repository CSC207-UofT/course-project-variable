# Scenario Walkthrough:

All users login to the system with their chosen username
and password. Each user has an associated calendar. The system
should ask if the user wishes to import a calendar or
manually input their recurring/weekly and one-off events. The system should then
ask for the names, days and times of all said events the user is participating
in. Afterwards, the system should output the calendar. Then, the system
is responsible for asking if the user wishes to either create a new group, 
or join an existing group using a group name/ID.
